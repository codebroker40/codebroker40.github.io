<p>Note: I'm not actually gonna write about an album every day, but I'm gonna try to listen to some </p> </br>
<p> Jazzinuf is a lo-fi artist, and I was introduced to the namesake song "Coffee and Cigarettes" a few days ago.  I don't listen to lo-fi religiously, but I enjoy it enough to give this album a listen.  I'm live writing this as I'm listening, and I'm at work so I'm not giving it my full attention. The album has a nice engaging intro track in "Oreos" which goes into the namesake track "Coffee and Cigarettes."  I absolutely love this track.  The Pulp Fiction sample at the start is cute and ntoo long, and the piano sample is more interesting than average.  The album feels episodic, with standard fade-in/outs on every track rather than being blended together.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I always love seamless transitions between tracks.  Jazzinuf leans heavily toward piano and saxophone samples that are all over this genre, but I didn't recognize any overused samples, which is nice.  Other than that, it's really just a standard selection of lo-fi tracks.  Each track has a cute intro and makes you think, "Oh this beat kinda slaps," only to fade into the back of your mind for the rest of the song.  This isn't a negative thing to me, it's just a feature of the genre.  Some tracks are excluded in this and have a complete transition to a new beat, like "Girl with the Braided Hair."  The album becomes a little adventurous towards the end, with an unorthodox vocal sample in "Flying Train" and a high-tension sample in "The Walk."  The album goes back to lo-fi roots for the final track "When the Evening Comes," which has a standard beat and light vocal sample.  Overall, I'd say this LP is worth a go if you wanna turn your brain off.  It's not a very involved listening experience, but neither is anything in this genre.  Peace.</p>
